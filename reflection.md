# Reflection Document

* Full Name :  Lucas Podowski      
* Student ID:  001907164

Objective:  
* You are creating a program to analyze headlines from the Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC).
Your program is going to read in the file chosen by the user, and then allow them to request specific types of analysis on that file.
The headlines included in this assignment are real headlines from this real news agency.

What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?
Procedure:
* I thought of high level tasks first like each option the user has to analyse the file as well as inputs and outputs 
needed. I also needed to research a little to look for how to find min and max headline.
* Key concepts were practice with files, lists, and functions

Results:  
* The code worked as expected
* I tried a few different test cases such as different words, output file names, and input file searches


Reflection:
* One of the biggest challenges was figuring how to run the main file.
* I first thought of high level tasks, then started coding and tested as I coded. I then used test cases 
to check different conditions.
* I overcame the challenge by just coding and letting the momentum carry me to finish the code and ultimately making a
main file with more code in it than I normally use.
* A key takeaway was improvement in how to use and read lists in programs with files.
* Working with myself was ok, there were challenging parts to this code but working with myself let me practice more.
